I‚Äôm **Zirui Gong**, a PhD student in Computer Science at Griffith University, Australia. My research focuses on the intersection of **federated learning**, **machine learning security**, and **sparse subnetworks**, with a particular interest in analyzing **vulnerabilities in Lottery Ticket Hypothesis-based FL frameworks**.

I‚Äôve served as a reviewer for several top-tier AI and security conferences including ICLR, CVPR, IJCAI, AAAI, AsiaCCS, and AISTATS.

Outside of research, I enjoy working on open-source projects, exploring adversarial machine learning topics, and learning new languages ‚Äî both human and programming ones.
