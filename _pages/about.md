I’m Zirui Gong, a second-year PhD student in AI Security at **Griffith University**, working under the **TrustAGI Lab**. My research is centered on uncovering security and privacy vulnerabilities in **Federated Learning (FL)** systems, with the goal of improving the resilience and trustworthiness of distributed machine learning.

## Research Interests

- Federated Learning Security
- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
- Adversarial Attacks & Defenses
- Secure Distributed Systems

## Academic Activities

I actively contribute to the academic community by:

- Reviewing papers for top AI and security conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, IJCAI, AAAI, AISTATS, AsiaCCS).
- Presenting ongoing research within the **TrustAGI Lab**.
- Mentoring postgraduate students on backdoor and fine-grained poisoning attacks in FL.

## Teaching

At Griffith, I work as a **Teaching Assistant**, contributing to the following courses:

- **Trustworthy AI** – covering adversarial machine learning, explainability, and fairness.
- **Ethical Hacking** – assisting with penetration testing, secure coding, and risk analysis.
- **Programming Principles (Python)** – guiding students in algorithm design and debugging.
