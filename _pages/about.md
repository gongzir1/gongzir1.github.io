Iâ€™m Zirui Gong, a second-year PhD student in AI Security at **Griffith University**, working under the **TrustAGI Lab**. My research is centered on uncovering security and privacy vulnerabilities in **Federated Learning (FL)** systems, with the goal of improving the resilience and trustworthiness of distributed machine learning.

My work has been published in top-tier venues including:

- **IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P) 2025**
- **IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS)**

I hold a First-Class Honours degree in Information Technology from **Deakin University**, where I developed a strong research foundation in secure AI systems and adversarial learning.
