### [Trustworthy AI (3015ICT)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/courses/trustworthy-ai-3015ICT#trimester-2-brisbane-south-nathan)
This course introduces key aspects of building trustworthy machine learning systems. Topics include:
- **Adversarial machine learning** and **backdoor attacks**  
- **Privacy-preserving techniques**, including federated learning  
- **Fairness**, **accountability**, and **explainability** in AI  
I assist in tutorials, labs, and assessments, and help students implement attack and defense techniques in practice.
