### [Ethical Hacking (3009ICT)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/courses/ethical-hacking-3009ICT)
Ethical Hacking provides students with practical cybersecurity knowledge from an attackerâ€™s perspective. Core topics include:
- **Penetration testing** and **vulnerability assessment**  
- **Secure coding**, **threat modeling**, and **defensive strategies**  
- Use of tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit  
My duties involve supporting students in lab environments, debugging technical issues, and guiding ethical considerations.
