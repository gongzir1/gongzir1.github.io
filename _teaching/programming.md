### [Programming Principles (1801ICT)]([https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/courses/programming-principles-1801ICT](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/courses/programming-principles-1811ICT#trimester-1-online))
This foundational course introduces students to programming using **Python**. It covers:
- Fundamental **programming constructs**, such as loops, functions, and conditionals  
- **Data structures** (lists, dictionaries, tuples)  
- **Problem solving**, **algorithm design**, and **debugging**  
I lead hands-on lab sessions, review code, assist with assignments, and help students strengthen their programming and computational thinking skills.
